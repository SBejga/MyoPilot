C# Application for controlling the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 with the Myo armband by Thalmic Labs

Current state: The application is able to controll the drone via keyboard or Xbox360 controller.

Requirements: Windows Vista or newer because of the Xbox controller. Under Windows XP, you'll need special drivers for your Xbox 360 Controller. You can find them at this address : [XBox 360 Controller for Windows Software](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34001) (cited from XInputDotNet Project page)
